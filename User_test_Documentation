### Feedback from CookAR team
**- It was a really cool experience and I liked the Paper-Design and the Graphics as well

- The 3D-Graphs and that the Application worked so well

- That you cannot interact so much with the Graphs... (would be cool that you can rotate them by clicking on it or zoom inside)

- The depiction of the Graphs and the included Videos ;)

- Nothing

- 4

- Very Rarely

- In the final-development it would be very nice to have more Interactions
