### Feedback from CookAR team member 01
- It was a really cool experience and I liked the Paper-Design and the Graphics as well
- The 3D-Graphs and that the Application worked so well
- That you cannot interact so much with the Graphs... (would be cool that you can rotate them by clicking on it or zoom inside)
- The depiction of the Graphs and the included Videos ;)
- Nothing
- 4
- Very Rarely
- In the final-development it would be very nice to have more Interactions

### Feedback from CookAR team member 02
- It was really fun to use the application. You could feel immersed in the diagram through the display. The form of the presentation made you feel as if you were holding a newspaper of the future in your hands.
- How simple and understandable it actually was. I really liked the design of the print media. 
- I actually didn't have any negative experiences
- How well everything worked and that you could actually display Videos/GIFs. Also, the changeable diagrams
- No nothing. Sometimes the tracking didn't work correctly, but that wasn't a big deal.
- 5
- It is an interesting way to display static information in 3D. I could also imagine that this visualization could find a lot of appeal in other areas. I personally would therefore use this application several times a week.
- Like I mentioned before: I think it would be really nice, to display information to other topics in the future maybe.

### Feedback from Pacman team
- It’s great fun. Extending your reading-experience by an AR component feels good. It was delightful to see data displayed with added dimensionality.
- Exploring. Every new page turn was exciting.
- That there wasn’t enough of it :D
- I didn’t expect the extent of flexibility when it came to viewing-angles!
- Nothing!
- 5 (very likely)
- Occasionally (2-3 times/week) / Frequently (1-2 Times a day)
- In my opinion this idea stands and falls with the quality of data visualisation. It’s important, that the displayed information gives added benefit, AND benefits from the added dimensionality. Maybe readability could me improved by calculating the viewing angle and tilting fonts, so users always see text from the very front. What I noticed while thinking more about it, is that right now the augmented experience overshadows the original experience. On some pages there was text, but it wasn’t readable through the AR view, and (maybe even got overplayed by the AR elements). It could be interesting to explore the degree of importance that the AR element takes within the experience, and if it should be lessened. I really liked the augmented gifs because they allowed for classical reading while adding the novelty of “video on paper”.
