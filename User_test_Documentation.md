### Feedback from CookAR team member 01
- It was a really cool experience and I liked the Paper-Design and the Graphics as well
- The 3D-Graphs and that the Application worked so well
- That you cannot interact so much with the Graphs... (would be cool that you can rotate them by clicking on it or zoom inside)
- The depiction of the Graphs and the included Videos ;)
- Nothing
- 4
- Very Rarely
- In the final-development it would be very nice to have more Interactions

### Feedback from CookAR team member 02
-It was really fun to use the application. You could feel immersed in the diagram through the display. The form of the presentation made you feel as if you were holding a newspaper of the future in your hands.
-How simple and understandable it actually was. I really liked the design of the print media. 
-I actually didn't have any negative experiences
-How well everything worked and that you could actually display Videos/GIFs. Also, the changeable diagrams
-No nothing. Sometimes the tracking didn't work correctly, but that wasn't a big deal.
-5
-It is an interesting way to display static information in 3D. I could also imagine that this visualization could find a lot of appeal in other areas. I personally would therefore use this application several times a week.
-Like I mentioned before: I think it would be really nice, to display information to other topics in the future maybe.
