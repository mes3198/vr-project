### Feedback from CookAR team
- It was a really cool experience and I liked the Paper-Design and the Graphics as well
- The 3D-Graphs and that the Application worked so well
- That you cannot interact so much with the Graphs... (would be cool that you can rotate them by clicking on it or zoom inside)
- The depiction of the Graphs and the included Videos ;)
- Nothing
- 4
- Very Rarely
- In the final-development it would be very nice to have more Interactions
