### Requirements
Functional Requirements
* The user will be able to switch between different pandemics (SARS-COV-2, Hong Kong Flu, Swine Flu, Ebola, COVID-19) on a menu. The menu will always be in view, and to select the menu option, the user will be able to push the button and click OK to confirm. The default bar graph for the selected menu will then pop-up.
The user will have access to another menu (graph-type). After the user has selected their preferred pandemic data set, they will have the option to choose which way they would like the data set presented. The options will be a bar graph, line graph, bubble chart and pie chart. The way in which the user can select their preferred data visualization will be the same as the pandemic menu (clicking on the menu.)
* In order to understand the data more precisely the user will have the one more color scheme menu option to choose color for the data representation, Furthermore, user can use the functionality of zoom in or change the angle to get complete interpretation of the specific data
The user will have the option to turn off the AR projection at all times.

Quality Requirements
* The user expects the graph load quickly (little lag time) when and where they expect the 3D graph to load
* They expect that they can navigate easily through a menu of options
* They expect to be able to interact with the graph in some way (getting closer to it, zooming in, looking closer at different data points for more information) in order to examine it more deeply

What is not in scope
* Giant data sets
