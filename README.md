### AR Data Visualization Application
Megan Smith + Milly Attree 

### The Idea/Motivation/Proposed Outcome
**Idea:** An AR application which can be downloaded onto the users phone. The phone is pointed at an image (graph, chart, etc.) on a piece of paper, and then the app loads the 3D visualization. The user will be able to point the app at different images to display various data visualizations of varying complexity. 

**Motivation:** Educational tool 

**Proposed Outcome:** An app which allows the user to 


### Interaction Techniques
**Menu for pandemics** The VR user has the opportunity to utilize a menu inside the app. This menu gives the user control over which pandemic data set they can view, which will range from coronavirus, Spanish flu, ebola, MERS, SARS etc. Each of these data sets will include a category for the infected, recovered and death rates from the selected pandemic (along the x axis), how many people fell into the aforementioned three categories (y axis) over a range of months (z axis.)

**Menu for type of data visualization** The user will have the option to see the data their chart of choice, such as bar graph, line graph, etc. The user will be able to go back and forth between these option at will to gain more clarity about the numbers.

**See different angles through phone** The user will be able to move closer (or zoom in and out) of the data visualization, as well as view the model at different angles. 

### Outline of Planned Implementation
**Personas, User Research, Storyboards**
*  Who is our target group for this simulation, who is the most likely to use it?
*  What do users actually want, what are they looking for? What do they want to achieve or learn from this simulation?
* Whatâ€™s a scenario where this might help the user, what scenario will this type of application be useful?

**Collection of data**
* Collecting data that is relevant and important to the user
* Collecting data that makes it easy to draw conclusions about events and extrapolate the relevant information
* 

**Visual Design**
* Design of the chart (colors, width, transparency) keeping in mind what will make it most clear for the user 
* Design of the navigation menu (making things user-friendly, on-brand)
* Design something that is not only informative but sharp/modern
* Design with interaction in mind (bars moving up and down, 

**Implementation in Unity**
* Design the VR scene
* With collected statistics, recreate the movement of the respiratory droplets in the 4 different representations
* Create a fuction where the respiratory droplets leave a "mark" or "splatter" so the Viewer can see the result of the ejection
* Allow for these drops and splatter to hit objects (that may have been moved by the viewer
* Create navigation for the user to go back and forth through options and timeleines (pressing buttons, swiping)

**Testing**
* What does the user like/dislike?
* What should be changed and why?
* How interactable is the prototype?
* Does it work as expected?
* What can we improve/take out to make it easier to understand?

**Implementation in Unity**
* Taking lessons learned from user testing and implementing those changes

**Final delivery**
* Documentation
* Presentation
