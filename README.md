### AR Pandemic/Virus Data Visualization
The Team is Comprised of:
Milly + Megan
### The Idea/Motivation/Proposed Outcome
**Idea:** An AR app which displays data sets from the current coronavirus pandemic (deaths, infected, recovered, etc.) with the option to compare/contrast these data sets between each other, between different areas and other projections. This AR app can be used on the users phone to display the data visualizations in their space of choice. 

**Motivation:** To make an educational tool that informs users about pandemics, both past, future and present. Data visualization at its core allows people to easily digest information that is sometimes abstract and might otherwise take up valuable time to understand. Furthermore, 3D representations of data often give users the chance to comprehend the data in ways that 2D can’t manage. The motivation is to improve comprehension of data sets by creating such a visualization. 

**Proposed Outcome:** An AR simulation that displays relevant pandemic statistics in 3D (using one’s phone as the viewpoint) wherein the user can select multiple data sets to compare and contrast in order to get a better comprehension of these data sets. 


### Interaction Techniques
**Different viewpoints:** one way in which the user can interact with the data sets is to see them from different angles and at different proportions. Enlarging part of the data set will make small differences easier to see, thus increasing comprehension of the data set. Another interaction: is the user has the ability to physically walk around the AR projection, they’ll be able to see it from different angles and focus on parts of the data set they might have missed

**Different data set:** One interaction integral to data comparison is getting to select different data sets to compare/contrast. One example of different selections would be their individual state and area from which they can see data points. This will especially be of interest to users who have a particular concern over an area. Another example is that they can choose between deaths, positive results and recovered patients, which have been dominant statistics of concern for many individuals. Another option is allowing users to see statistics from previous pandemics. This type of visualization will allow users to make comparisons between this current situation and other situations, and allow trends to become visible more easily.

**Navigation through the data sets**An important interaction is allowing the user to easily navigate through these data sets. This will have to be determined once the data parameters have been set. Perhaps in this scenario, there is a “basic” view and then the user can add/remove different data sets as they wish. 

**Navigation through phone:** Another interaction that needs to be considered is how the user will navigate on their phone to get to the app.

### Outline of Planned Implementation
**Personas, User Research, Storyboards**
*  Who is our target group for this AR, who is the most likely to use it?
*  What do users actually want, what are they looking for? 
* What’s a scenario where the AR might help the user, what scenario will this type of application be useful?

**Collection of statistics**
* At this point we determine exactly which statistics we will represent in the app
* Where are we targeting (which states, which cities, etc.)
* What pandemic data sets from this and other pandemics (deaths, positive tests, recovery, etc.)

**Visual Design**
* Designing how these statistics are going to look like
* What is the best way to represent them (what color, are they transparent, etc.)
* How “3D” do we make the representation?
* What values do we use to make the data sets comparable?
**Implementation in Unity**
* Inputting these statistics into Unity
* Implementing the visual design
* Necessary coding to make it interactive

**Testing**
* What does the user like/dislike?
* What should be changed and why?
* How interactable is the prototype?
* Does it work as expected?
* What can we improve/take out to make it easier to understand?

**Implementation in Unity**
* Taking lessons learned from user testing and implementing those changes

**Final delivery**
* Documentation
* Presentation
