### AR Data Visualization Application
Megan Smith + Milly Attree 

### The Idea/Motivation/Proposed Outcome
**Idea:** An AR application which can be downloaded onto the users phone. The phone is pointed at an image (graph, chart, etc.) on a piece of paper, and then the app loads the 3D visualization. The user will be able to point the app at different images to display various data visualizations of varying complexity. 

**Motivation:** Educational tool 

**Proposed Outcome:** An app which allows the user to 


### Interaction Techniques
**Menu for pandemics** The VR user has the opportunity to change up the scene on the table. Any object on the table can be moved closer or farther from Person A (the sneezer.) This can add further impact as the viewer will see respiratory droplets land on mugs, handles and other objects that are often touched by others, and see how easily infected droplets can spread the virus. 

**Menu for type of data visualization** The user will have 4 options: what is the respiratory droplet trajectory from a sneeze or cough? What is the trajectory when Person A has a mask on? How much contamination is caused then? The user will have the opportunity to play with these different settings to enhance the understanging of how important wearing a mask is. 

**See different angles through phone**Once an option is selected, the VR user will have the option to speed up or slow down how long it takes for droplets to settle. (Some are larger and will fall more quickly, others are smaller and will take more time to fall.) Instead of waiting several minutes for all droplets to fall to see the final result, the user can skip to the end to see what the final scene looks like. The user will also have the option to reset the simulation and try a different option.

### Outline of Planned Implementation
**Personas, User Research, Storyboards**
*  Who is our target group for this simulation, who is the most likely to use it?
*  What do users actually want, what are they looking for? What do they want to achieve or learn from this simulation?
* Whatâ€™s a scenario where this might help the user, what scenario will this type of application be useful?

**Collection of data**
* It is crucial to collect the speed at which droplets of different sizes leave the mouth, where they will fall and how long the smaller droplets will linger in the air
* Collect data on a "typical" sneeze or cough, and how much of these "typical" ejections are comprised of small, medium or large droplets
* Collect data on typical airflow in a room

**Visual Design**
* Designing of how the droplets are going to be represented, what they will look like when ejected from the mouth, what do they look like hanging in the air, what do they look like when they land on various objects in the scene. 
* Design of the user interface: how to make it easy for the user to understand their option, to choose between them, to navigate through the proposed "timeline" and to go back and forth between settings
* Design of the scene: the cafe table, items on the table, the other people in the scene

**Implementation in Unity**
* Design the VR scene
* With collected statistics, recreate the movement of the respiratory droplets in the 4 different representations
* Create a fuction where the respiratory droplets leave a "mark" or "splatter" so the Viewer can see the result of the ejection
* Allow for these drops and splatter to hit objects (that may have been moved by the viewer
* Create navigation for the user to go back and forth through options and timeleines (pressing buttons, swiping)

**Testing**
* What does the user like/dislike?
* What should be changed and why?
* How interactable is the prototype?
* Does it work as expected?
* What can we improve/take out to make it easier to understand?

**Implementation in Unity**
* Taking lessons learned from user testing and implementing those changes

**Final delivery**
* Documentation
* Presentation
